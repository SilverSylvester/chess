# Chess Engine in Pure Haskell

This hopes to be a resonably useful implementation of a chess
engine in (as close as possible to) pure Haskell. Obviously
still a work in progress.

This is (as of now) mostly a transcription of the
[chessprogramming](https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/) wiki and is
more of a tutorial for myself on Haskell and chess programming in general.
